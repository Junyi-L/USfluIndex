  abstract  = {The main features of the Aitchison geometry of the simplex of D parts are reviewed. Compositions are positive vectors in which the relevant information is contained in the ratios between their components or parts. They can be represented in the simplex of D parts by closing them to a constant sum, e.g. percentages, or parts per million. Perturbation and powering in the simplex of D parts are respectively an internal operation, playing the role of a sum, and of an external product by real numbers or scalars. These operations impose the structure of (D - 1)-dimensional vector space to the simplex of D parts. An inner product, norm and distance, compatible with perturbation and powering, complete the structure of the simplex, a structure known in mathematical terms as a Euclidean space. This general structure allows the representation of compositions by coordinates with respect to a basis of the space, particularly, an orthonormal basis. The interpretation of the so-called balances, coordinates with respect to orthonormal bases associated with groups of parts, is stressed. Subcompositions and balances are interpreted as orthogonal projections. Finally, log-ratio transformations (alr, clr and ilr) are considered in this geometric context.},

The correction is of particular use when the sample size is small, or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size. The corrected method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient if the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore, when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method. Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive moving average time series models are also discussed.}},

  abstract  = {Author Summary Influenza epidemics occur annually, and incur significant losses in terms of lost productivity, sickness, and death. Policy makers employ countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, to combat the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases, but epidemics exhibit a wide range of behavior, which makes designing and planning these efforts difficult. Accurate and reliable numerical forecasts of how an epidemic will behave, as well as advance notice of key events, could enable policy makers to further specialize countermeasures for a particular season. While a large amount of work already exists on modeling epidemics in past seasons, work on forecasting is relatively sparse. Specially tailored models for historical data may be overly strict and fail to produce behavior similar to the current season. We designed a framework for predicting epidemics without making strong assumptions about how the disease propagates by relying on slightly modified versions of past epidemics to form possibilities for the current season. We report forecasts generated for the 2013–2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “Predict the Influenza Season Challenge”, and assess its accuracy retrospectively.},
